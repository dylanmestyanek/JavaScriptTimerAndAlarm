# JavaScriptTimerAndAlarm

<b>Description:</b> This application is a voice activated timer built with the bare bone basics of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.


<b>How it works:</b> This project was my first experience using the Google Chrome's `Speech Recognition` functionality. Building on top of a standard timer application, I incorporated the `Speech Recognition` functionality to listen to your command, and operate if the command matches one it is familiar with.

<b>Getting Started:</b>

1) `Fork` and `clone` this project onto your local PC.
2) Seeing as this is built with vanilla JavaScript, there won't be any commands to run, just simply use an extension, such as: `VS Code Live Server`, and preview the `index.html` in your browser.
3) Try to break it! 

<b>Note:</b> When testing the app as a user, know that the commands the application can respond to need to follow one of these formats:

1) `Set a timer for _____ minutes.`
2) `Set a timer for _____ minutes and _____ seconds.`
3) `Set a timer for _____ seconds and _____ minutes.`
4) `Set a timer for _____ seconds.`

<b>Warning:</b> The `Speech Recognition` functionality is only supported in Google Chrome. When running the program on a computer, be sure to view the application in Google Chrome for full functionality. When running on mobile, be sure to run on Android <i>and</i> Google Chrome, otherwise the `Speech Recognition` functionality will not be supported.
